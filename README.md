# Prodigy-InfoTech_Intership_DS_Task_2

1. Analysis
-> Univariate Analysis
-> Multivariate Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
-> Creating new columns
-> Modifying existing ones
3. Handling Outliers
-> Detect Outliers
-> Remove outliers
   
At first, I imported the essential libraries, and after analyzing the data I divided it into specific columns such as categorical columns, numerical columns, and mixed columns.
I have also found that there are some missing values in the data and have drawn some valuable conclusions from it. After inputting missing values, I changed the data type of some columns which were mismatched with the original ones.
Next, I implemented univariate analysis on the particular columns and got to know deeper about the data. For gaining deeper insights, I used the Seaborn library and plotted various plots such as countplot, distplot, and boxplot. It helped me to gain meaningful insights about my data.
Similarly, I implemented multivariate analysis for further analysis.
Then, I used the very important concept of feature engineering to engineer the new features on my data and to make it more understandable and useful.
Last but not least, is the detection of outliers on numerical and categorical data. Removing the outliers using one hot encoding concept by using the get_dummies function.
At last, the final conclusion by performing all the tasks. In this, I really get to know more about my data and was able to understand it deeply. Gathering some useful insights from the data.
